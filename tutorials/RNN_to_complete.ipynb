These model take into account the sequentiality (or temporality) of the data. That is, they model each word using its surrounding context (most often the words that appeared previously). \n",

    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are models designed for such varying-length data. By varying length we mean that each example may have a different length (for example if each example is a sentence, then sentences could have different lengths). More formally, two sentences $\\mathbf{s}_{i} = (x_{i,1}, \\dots, x_{i,N})$ and $\\mathbf{s}_{j} = (x_{j,1}, \\dots, x_{j,M})$ are of different lengths if $N \\neq M$. The hidden layer of an RNN  $\\mathbf{h}_{t} \\in \\mathbb R^{d_{h}}$, also known as a recurrent state, is a $d_{h}$-dimensional vector which represents the memory of the network through time. At each time step $t$, the recurrent state is a recursive function which updates itself using the input variables $x_{t}$ and its recurrent state at the previous timestep $\\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$. This function can be written down as\n",

    "In theory, RNNs can model arbitrarily long dependencies in sequences. In practice, it was shown that it is difficult to learn long-term dependices using RNNs (see this [article from Bengio et al. (1994)](http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it/paolo/ps/tnn-94-gradient.pdf) for the details). The intuition is as follows. RNNs are recursive models and their parameters are shared through all timesteps (e.g., for a sequence of length 10, the same parameters will be used on the order of 10 times). Let us think of how the error calculated at the last step will be lead to an update at the first step. The gradient will have to flow back through each recurent state in reverse order. This sequence of operations involves a sequence of multiplications (through the chain rule of derivation). For a sequence of $N$ timesteps, this could have two effects: 1) the gradient could be multiplied by a sequence of small numbers and tend to 0; 2) the gradient can be multiplied by a sequence of large numbers and tend to very large values. The former is called the *vanishing gradient problem*, while the latter the *exploding gradient problem*. "

    "\n",
    "Recall that a cost function  $J(\\theta) = L(x, y, \\theta)$ takes as input a prediction and the target and evaluates some distance (or discrepancy) between both.  For this example, we will use the mean squared error cost which is standard for regression problems (see [torch.nn.MSELoss()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$J(\\cdot) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\hat{y}_{i} - y_i)^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize the parameters of our networks we will use the *stochastic gradient descent* (SGD) optimizer. It minimizes the cost function $J(\\theta)$ parametrized by the networks' weights $\\theta$ by updating them using the following update rule: $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\alpha \\nabla J(\\theta)$, where  $\\alpha$ is the *learning rate*. The specificity of SGD is that ti will calculate the gradient $\\nabla$ using a single (or a small number of) example(s) instead of the full training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch we will use <a href=\"http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.SGD\">`torch.optim.SGD()`</a> which is a SGD implementation. In this example, we will use a learning rate of 0.01."

    "The objective of the second part of the tutorial is to learn about text generation using recurrent neural networks. In particular, we will learn a recurrent neural network using a small amount of textual data written by [Shakespeare]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare). Once this model is trained, we will use it to generate new text in the style of Shakespeare.\n",

    "**Note** that people often use the term RNN even when training an LSTM. RNN has become the generic term regardless of the type (in addition to LSTMs that are other variants that are commonly used such as [Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)).\n",

    "The model we will use is a bit more complex than the one for task 1. Contrary to the previous section, all code is provided (i.e., there are no exercises to complete). We suggest you go through all of the code to ensure that you understand both its logic as it relates to text processing but also how to design and train an RNN for text generation. The code could be relatively easily adapted to other tasks that you may care about. \n",

    "## A bit more context to understand language modelling\n",
    "(this was already covered in class)\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence of words $\\mathbf{s}$ can be represented as a sequence of $N$ discrete symbols (or lexical tokens) such that $\\mathbf{s} = (w_{1}, \\dots, w_{N})$, where $w_{t}$ is a word or a punctation mark. Each symbol can be represented by an integer corresponding to its index in the vocabulary $V$. $V$ contains all symbols for a particular task (the vocabulary is usually built from the dataset we use for a task). The objective of a language model is to estimate the (joint) probability of a sequence $p(\\mathbf{s}) = p(w_{1}, \\dots, w_{N})$, which can be decomposed as a product of conditional probabilities such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  p(\\mathbf{s}) = \\prod^{N}_{t=1} p(w_{t} | w_{1}, \\dots, w_{t-1}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "(this is also known as the chain rule in probability theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important for modelling. In particular, instead of modelling the joint distribution directly, we can \"simply\" model each conditional. That is we can model the probability of the next word given all previous words ($p(w_{t} | w_{<t})$). Language models do just that and are widely used across numerous applications (including in automatic translation, speech recognition, and information retrieval). Note that this can be understood as a multi-class classification problem where the classes corresponds to the different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modelling each conditional is not easy. Instead we perform an approximation which makes the problem easier. The intuition behind the approximation is that instead of conditioning of the whole history we condition on a smaller history ($w_{t-1}, w_{t-2}, \\ldots, w_{t-n}$) to predict the next word ($w_{t}$). This is also known as a $n-1$-order Markov assumption. Mathematically it is:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  p(w_{t} | w_{1}, \\dots, w_{t-1}) \\approx p(w_{t} | w_{t-n+1}, \\dots, w_{t-1}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next paragraph we explain how to model the above conditionals using a recurrent neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of the neural language model we use is an LSTM networks which will learn at each timestep a conditional distribution of the next word using a number of previous words.\n",
    "To train its parameters, we first need to set the maximum number $n-1$ of previous words to consider (`seq_len` in the code)--this is the effective size of your history--for training $p(w_{t} | w_{t-n+1}, \\dots, w_{t-1})$. The input to the LSTM at each time step is: 1) the $t$'th word $w_t$ encoded using its *word embedding* (see below); 2) the recurrent state ($mathbf{h}_{t-1}$); and 3) the state of the memory at the previous timestep ($\\mathbf{c}_{t-1}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the output of the LSTM at each step is the next word $w_{t+1}$, that is we train the LSTM to predict the next word at each step (in details the LSTM will actually predict the probability of that next word). This also implies that once this model is trained we will be able to use it to generate text (we will simply pick the word with the highest probability and feed it as the input to the next step). This type of model is commonly known as an *LSTM-based neural network model*. Its architecture is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt-text](https://github.com/mila-iqia/dlschool-ivado-a19/blob/master/images/autoregressive_english.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the probability over all next words we simply use a *softmax* activation function. The softmax function returns a normalized $|V|$-dimensional vector, where each entry corresponds to a single word in the vocabulary. Each entry can be understood as the \"probability\" that the next word should the word at this index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question that remains is how exactly to encode the words at each timestep. \n",
    "Since the input data to a neural network must be encodable in a matrix, each symbol (word) $w_t$ in the vocabulary can be represented as a *one-hot* vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$ which is a vector of zeros with a single 1 at the position of the index of this word in the vocabulary. These one-hot vectors are multiplied by a weight matrix $\\mathbf{E} \\in \\mathbb R^{|V| \\times d_{e}}$. This matrix is learned and is known as the *embedding matrix*, $\\mathbf{E} \\in \\mathbb R^{|V| \\times d_{e}}$, it effectively encodes words in a continuous representation: $\\mathbf{w}_{t} \\in \\mathbb R^{d_{e}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using word embeddings, a sequence of words can therefore be represented a sequence of size-$N$ vectors $\\mathbf{s} = (\\mathbf{w}_{1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{w}_{N})$. Each line $i$ of this matrix $\\mathbf{E}$ is a representation in $d_{e}$ dimensions of the $i$'th word in the vocabulary $V$. As we said above, these representations are often called *word embeddings*. When they are learned from a large enough dataset, they can represent semantic similarity.

    "\n",
    "* We use dropout on the input *word embeddings* as well as on the output layer of the LSTM. The small size of our data makes regularization important. In particular, for language models based on recurrent neural networks, we suggest using a fairly large droput value.\n",
    "* We change the learning rate through training. We begin with a fairly high one (see `learning_rate`) and divide it by 10 as a function of the validation error at the end of each *epoch*. In particular we use this class:  [torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html?highlight=plateau#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau).\n",
    "* To mitigate the problem of *exploding gradient* we use a *gradient-clipping* approach and normalize the norm of the gradient using this function [torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=clip#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_).\n",
    "* We initialize to 0.0 the values of the tuple containing the recurrent state and the hidden memory state $(\\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{c}_{0})$ using the `init_hidden()` function. We do this only once at the beginning of each *epoch* and we propagate the new values of hidden through all training minibatches. In other words, the data has beeen structured using the `batch_data()` function such that we can initialize `hidden` $(\\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{c}_{0})$ of each sequence of minibatch using $(\\mathbf{h}_{T}, \\mathbf{c}_{T})$ of the previous minibatch. Using this method implies that we cannot shuffle the order of the sequences at each training *epoch* (i.e., `train_loader = DataLoader(train_set, batch_size=seq_len, shuffle=False)`).\n",
    "* Our cost function is the cross-entropy [torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=crossentropy#torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss) which is standard for multi-class classification problems.\n",
    "* We will use *[perplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity)* as a way to measure the quality of our model. The intuition is that a good model should not be perplex when evaluating new data. "
