Filters are generally of size *n* \\* *n* where *n* is usually odd. The filters are parametrized by weights, one for each of its entry, which are learned by the convolutional network.\n","\n","The filter used in the previous example is:\n","\n","![Alt Text](https://github.com/mila-iqia/ecole_dl_mila_ivado/blob/master/tutoriaux/CNN/images/d7acc4aeb74d9e9cb5fb51482a302196594837fe.png?raw=true)\n","\n","### Depth\n","\n","We typically use *M* of filters which can be understood as the depth of the layer (see below). Note that this is different from the depth of the network (which is the number of layers). M is a hyperparameter. Here, each filter's output (blue circles) is represented as a single depth dimension on the output.\n","\n","![Alt Text](https://github.com/mila-iqia/ecole_dl_mila_ivado/blob/master/tutoriaux/CNN/images/Conv_layer.png?raw=true)\n","\n","### Stride\n","\n","The stride corresponds to the number of pixels the filter moves over in between each step of the convolution. The stride is measured in terms of a number of pixels. We typically use strides of 1 or 2. The larger the stride, the smaller the dimension of the output.\n","\n","### Zero padding\n","\n","Zero padding consists in padding (adding) a border of zeros around the input image. This can be useful to preserve the dimension from input to output.\n","\n","Below is an example of a zero padding which preserves the dimensions from input to output. Here, zero padding is set to 1, stride is set to 1, and the filter has size 3x3.\n","\n","![Alt Text](https://github.com/mila-iqia/ecole_dl_mila_ivado/blob/master/tutoriaux/CNN/images/same_padding_no_strides.gif?raw=true)\n","\n","\n","### Max Pooling\n","\n","In addition to convolutions, CNNs usually have pooling layers. The goal of pooling is to reduce the dimensionality of the input in-between two convolution layers to reduce the number of parameters in the network. For example, the famous LeNet CNN, uses max pooling with 2x2 filters and a stride of 2. Max pooling outputs the max value in a 2x2 region. This output is then the input of the next layer.\n","\n","Here is an example of the max pooling operation:\n","\n","![Alt Text](https://github.com/mila-iqia/ecole_dl_mila_ivado/blob/master/tutoriaux/CNN/images/maxpool.jpeg?raw=true)\n","\n","\n","### Receptive Field\n","\n","The receptive field is a measure of the CNNs' capacity to perceive information at different input scales. In an MLP (fully connected), the features are connected to every neuron. The receptive field of this MLP is the full image.\n","\n","For CNNs, convolution operations typically imply sparse connections. In other words, each filter only has a local receptive field. However, each successive layer will have access to a slightly larger receptive field. \n","\n","Let's look at an example. Imagine a 3x3 filter with stride set to 1. In this case, the first layer's receptive field is a maximum of 3x3. However, the more layer we add the more we increase the network's receptive field. Adding a second layer with 3xe3 filters and a stride of 1, our receptive field is increased to 5x5. Adding a third 3x3 layer further increases our receptive field to 7x7.\n","\n","What is the advantage of using multiple smaller successive filters instead of a single larger one? A single large filter of 7x7 implies 49 parameters. Instead 3 layers of 3x3 filters requires only 27 parameters (9 \\* 3). It is therefore more efficient to use multiple successive filters and in both cases the receptive field is the same (7x7). In addition, by using multiple successive filters, we can introduce more non-linearities in the model (one after each filter).\n","\n","Here the 3x3 filter (in grey) with a stride of 1 has a receptive field of 5x5 (yellow region):\n","\n","![Alt Text](https://github.com/mila-iqia/ecole_dl_mila_ivado/blob/master/tutoriaux/CNN/images/sNBmKMKAz-yJeCuS14usSqw.png?raw=true)\n","\n","\n","### Number of dimensions\n","\n","In general, for a convolutional layers with input dimensions (volume)\n","$W_1 * H_1 * D_1$ and hyperparameters \n","\n","* Number of filters = $K$\n","\n","* Filter sizes = $F$\n","\n","* Stride = $S$\n","\n","* Zero Padding = $P$.\n","\n","We obtain an output volume of $W_2 * H_2 * D_2$ dimensions where  \n","\n","* $W_2 = (W_1 - F + 2P) / S + 1$\n","* $H_2 = (H1 - F + 2P) / S + 1$\n","* $D_2 = K$\n","\n","and the total number of parameters is $(F⋅F⋅D_1)⋅K$ weights and $K$ biases.\n","\n","For an in-depth analysis see [this paper](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"owIcd9VguyAe"},"source":["\n","## LeNet\n","CNNs have been developed to model images.
