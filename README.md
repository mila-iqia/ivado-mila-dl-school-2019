## Welcome!

Welcome to the IVADO/Mila Deep Learning school! In this repo, you will find all the material needed for completing the tutorials of the school as well as some supplementary material.

## Course Structure

All lectures are given in-person. Each lecture is followed by a tutorial. These tutorials are complementary to the lectures and apply concepts that have been covered throughout the school.

You will find in this github repo all tutorials in the [tutorials](https://github.com/mila-iqia/ivado-mila-dl-school-2019/tree/master/tutorials) folder. Each tutorial will be presented in two formats:

* one `TODO` format, in which templates are provided but code is left out for you to complete;
* one `Solutions` format where the suggested solutions to the tutorials are presented;

## Practical Information

We will be presenting the tutorials in the format of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). In order to facilitate usage/setup of the notebooks, we will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mila-iqia/ivado-mila-dl-school-2019/) which gives users access to an already setup python environment with all the necessary dependencies. It also gives access to free GPUs for cloud computation. Using Colab will require an internet connection. You can however use the notebooks locally if you so prefer but additional setup will be necessary.
